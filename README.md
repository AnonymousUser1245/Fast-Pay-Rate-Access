## Why This Solution?

The current PACT calculator, while functional, has several limitations:
- Long processing times that increase with each award lookup
- Must restart the entire process to change a single input
- Restricted to specific calculation paths
- Time-consuming for batch processing

Our solution provides immediate access to the information you need, when you need it.

## Performance Comparison

The graph above shows real-world timing comparisons between our solution and the PACT calculator. Two specific tests were conducted:

### Single Pay Rate Lookup
Looking up a pay rate for: Level 2 - Year 2, 16-year-old casual (Monday-Friday)
- Award Viewer: 17 seconds
- PACT Calculator: 36 seconds
- Time Saved: 19 seconds (53% faster)

### Multiple Pay Rate Lookups
Looking up four different pay rates in succession:
1. Level 2 - Year 2, 16-year-old casual (Monday-Friday)
2. Level 2 - Year 2, 17-year-old casual (Monday-Friday)
3. Level 2 - Year 1, 16-year-old full time (Monday-Friday)
4. Call centre principal customer contact specialist, adult full time (Monday-Friday)

Results:
- Award Viewer: 1 minute 12 seconds
- PACT Calculator: 3 minutes 21 seconds
- Time Saved: 2 minutes 9 seconds (64% faster)

The key difference: While PACT requires restarting the entire questionnaire for each lookup, our solution allows immediate access to any pay rate information through direct navigation and search.
